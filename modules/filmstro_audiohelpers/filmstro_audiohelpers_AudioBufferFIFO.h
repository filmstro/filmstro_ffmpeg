 The AudioBufferFIFO implements an actual sample buffer using JUCEs AbstractFIFO
 class. You can add samples from the various kind of formats, like float pointers
 or AudioBuffers. Then you can read into float arrays, AudioBuffers or even
 AudioSourceChannelInfo to be used directly in AudioSources.
